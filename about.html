        <h4>Motivations</h4>
				<p>
					With Netflix, Disney+ and various streaming platforms rising, it is crucial for big companies to 
					get a sense of what movies and shows people are interested in so that </br>they can retain their users. 
					This would also benefit the users since they would be able to access their favorite shows on the streaming 
					platforms, being able to escape </br>from any emotional stress caused at this time of uncertainty. 
					Through our project, we hope to provide meaningful information and trends regarding films on 
					multiple </br>streaming platforms for the companies as well as the consumers.

				</p>
		
		<h4>Data Processing</h4>
				<p>
					We found several datasets on <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> that contain information about TV shows and movies that are on
					different platforms, such as details about the preference of </br>different age groups and the countries that created
					the films. The information that we needed for each of the visualizations were mostly in multiple datasets, so we 
				</br>processed the data so that we had all the necessary variables in one dataset for each visualizations.
					For the first visualization which compares the trends of movie </br>tickets sold and netflix subscriptions, 
					we could not find any dataset related. So for this particular visualization, we manually created a dataset 
					from the statistics </br>available online.  
				</p>

		<h4>Design Processes</h4>
				<p>
					Our design process for the project entailed a lot of remodeling and improvements. We started out with a sketch of the 
					basic framework of the website and </br>visualizations, which looked rather different from current form. We made revisions and 
					improvements based on the feedback received along the way. One </br>method that we found extremely helpful in our design process 
					was the think-aloud study, where we could get honest and unfiltered comments of our project </br>from the users. 
				</p>

		<h4>Takeaways</h4>
				<p>
					Through this project, we learned the importance of having a storyline in visualizations. At one point in the design process,
					we only had the graphs sketched </br>out and did not have any components that would engage the users such as opening or closing statements. We realized that 
					it is important to make the users </br>understand the message of our project by creating a storyline so that they can follow along and get a sense of 
					our thought processes. We also realized the </br>power of colors. After incorporating a constant color scheme throughout the website, 
					the visualizations seem to communicate a clearer message. 
				</p>

		<h4>Team Work</h4>
				<p>
					We had a very structured work distribution for the project. We came up with the substructure together and each worked on one 
					of the four visualizations. </br>Throughout the project, we sought feedback and help from each other regarding the respective visualizations
					that we were in charge of. After working on </br>the distributed parts, we came together and proposed ideas on combining the visualizations 
					into a website as a final product. While a member of the team </br>was working on combining the visualizations, others worked on the analysis 
					part of the project and assisted in designing the final product.
